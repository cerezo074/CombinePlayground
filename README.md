# **Combine Playground**  

**Combine Playground** is a hands-on demonstration of Apple's **Reactive Framework â€“ Combine**. The goal of this project is to provide a **concise overview** of key components within the framework.  

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project  
This playground serves as a **quick reference** rather than a complete guide. For an in-depth understanding, check out Apple's official documentation. If you're looking for a more structured learning experience, I highly recommend:  

ðŸ“– [**Combine by Tutorials**](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/combine-asynchronous-programming-with-swift) â€“ This project is based on concepts from this book, which explains Combine in much more detail.  

Additionally, the accompanying **iOS project** explores advanced **time operators** like `throttle` and `debounce` with real-world examples.  

## ðŸ“‚ Playground Structure  
The playground is organized into **five pages**, each focusing on different aspects of Combine:  
- Each page contains **self-contained source code**, ready to run.  
- To see the output, simply **uncomment** the relevant code block.  

## ðŸš€ Get Started  
Clone the repo and start experimenting with **Combine**!  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/combine-playground.git
