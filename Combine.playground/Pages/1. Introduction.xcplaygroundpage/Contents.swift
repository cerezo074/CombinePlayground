 ### Definition
 
 The Combine framework provides a declarative approach for how your app processes events. Rather than potentially implementing multiple delegate, callbacks or completion handler closures, you can create a single processing chain for a given event source. Each part of the chain is a Combine operator that performs a distinct action on the elements received from the previous step. *By Apple*.
 
 ### Imperative vs Declarative
 
 With imperative programming, you express what you want to happen, step by step.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 ```
 let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 var evens: [Int] = []
 
 for number in numbers {
    if number % 2 == 0 {
        evens.append(number)
    }
 }
 
 var dobled: [Int] = []
 
 for number in evens {
    dobled.append(number * 2)
 }
 ```
 
 \
 With declarative programming, on the other hand, you write code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it (declare your desired results, but not the step-by-step).
 
 &nbsp;
 
 ````
 let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 let doubled = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 * 2 }
 ````

 ## ‚ÄúFoundation and UIKit/AppKit‚Äù
 
 \
 We've got different mechanisms to handle asynchronous programming
 
 \
 ![Old Style](old_style.png)
 
 \
 The old way üë®üèª‚Äçü¶≥:
 
 - NotificationCenter: Executes any piece of code at any moment.
 - Delegates: Send messages to your delegates at any moment.
 - GCD and Operations: Schedule code to be executed later.
 - Closures: Create detached code that can be invoked at any moment
 
 \
 Writing and app can be a mess due to different mechanisms interacting together for handling asynchronous code(Who doesn't need it ?).

 \
 Apple has integrated Combine's API deep into the Foundation framework, so **Timer**, **NotificationCenter** and core frameworks like **Core Data** already speak its language. Luckily, Combine is also very easy to integrate into your own code.

 There are just 3 core components:
